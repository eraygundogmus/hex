**hex** is an ecosystem delivering practices, philosophy and portability.

Sub components of hex enables developers to abstract their codes for better
portability between platforms. Encourages ones to write codes once in
functional approach, then run on mainstream environments such as cli, bot
platforms, cloud-function runtimes and web apis.

_This project is currently in early stages of its development. Descriptions
