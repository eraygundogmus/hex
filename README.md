# Intro

‚úñÔ∏è **hex** is an ecosystem delivering practices, philosophy and portability.

hex consists of a set of **component**s that are designed to be used together.
These sub-components enable developers to abstract their codes for better
portability between platforms. Encourages ones to write codes once in functional
approach, then run on mainstream environments such as cli, bot platforms,
cloud-function runtimes and web apis.

# üöÄ Jumpstart

Ensure that [Deno](https://deno.land/) 1.25 or higher is installed on your system first.

Install hex globally first, then create a new project:

```sh
$ deno install -A -f https://deno.land/x/hex/hex.ts

$ hex create my-project

Creating "hex web template 0.0.1" on my-project...
...
done.
```

Or run a file directly from the resource:

```sh
$ deno run https://deno.land/x/hex/src/functions/samples/basic.ts eser

{ payload: "hello eser" }
```
